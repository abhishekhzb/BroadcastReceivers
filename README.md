In Android, a broadcast is like a message that the system sends out when certain things happen, 
like :
when you turn on your device,
get a text message, 
receive a phone call, 
or switch to airplane mode. 

It's a way for different parts of your phone to know what's happening and react accordingly. 

For example, when your device connects to the internet, a broadcast is sent out so that apps can know and do things like update data or show notifications.
